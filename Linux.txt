Linux is a open-source Kernel not an  Operating system, based on Unix.
Kernel is the core part of an OS, managing system resources and communication between hardware and software.
It is known for its security,flexibility,low resource usage
Created by Linus Torvalds in 1991
Linux come from Linus + Unix
Unix is licensed and Linux is Open-Sourced
Kali,Ubuntu are known as Linux distribution (distros)
Bare-Matel installation of linux distro, hypervisor installation of linux distro

Log analysis:-
a log file store events, processes, messages, and other data from applications, OS, or devices. 
they provide information based on the actions performed by users, playing an important role in monitoring.
basically used for cyber security, admin roles, troubleshooting roles like shows error code.
location of log file -> cd /var/log -> ls
log file : 
boot [Purpose: Shows messages related to the system startup (booting process)
      Use: Helps identify if all services and hardware components loaded correctly when the system started.
      Example: You can use this to check if a service failed to start at boot.]
cron [Purpose: Useful for tracking if automated tasks (like backups or scripts) ran at the scheduled time.
      Use: Useful for tracking if automated tasks (like backups or scripts) ran at the scheduled time.
      Example: If a backup job fails, check this file to see if it even started.]
secure [Purpose: Logs security-related events like login attempts, sudo usage, and SSH access.
        Use: Helps track unauthorized access or failed login attempts.
        Example: Repeated failed logins from an unknown IP may signal a brute-force attack.]
maillog [Purpose: Logs activities of the mail server (like sendmail or postfix).
         Use: Used to troubleshoot email sending and receiving issues.
         Example: If users don’t receive emails, this log helps find the cause.]
httpd [Purpose: Contains logs for the Apache HTTP server (httpd).
       Use: Tracks web server access, errors, and other Apache-related activities.
       Example: Use this to see if a website is being accessed or if it’s throwing errors.]
messages [Purpose: A general-purpose system log file that stores messages from many system services.
          Use: Useful for catching miscellaneous system issues.
          Example: Hardware errors, kernel messages, or driver problems often show up here.]




Syslog:-
Syslog (System Logging Protocol) is a standard protocol for computer logging that allows devices and applications to send log messages to a central location for analysis and monitoring. It's widely used in Unix-like systems and networking devices to track system events, errors, and performance. Syslog facilitates centralized log management and provides insights into system health and security. 
Main Purpose of syslog
To record important events happening inside the system—such as logins, errors, warnings, boot info, and service activity—so that system administrators can monitor and troubleshoot issues.

Use Cases of syslog
Detect unauthorized access attempts
Monitor system health
Debug errors in applications
Track cron job execution
Review system reboots or shutdowns

The log file is usually located at:
/var/log/syslog
On Red Hat-based systems (RHEL, CentOS, Fedora), you may not see /var/log/syslog; instead, logs go to:
/var/log/messages
/var/log/secure

What Information Does syslog Contain?
It collects logs from:
The kernel
System services (e.g., cron, sshd)
Startup scripts
Network issues
Hardware events
Applications that use the syslog facility

How syslog Works (Behind the Scenes)
Services or applications generate messages.
These messages are passed to the syslog daemon (e.g., rsyslog, syslog-ng, or journald).
The daemon sorts the messages based on:
Facility: The type of program (auth, mail, daemon, etc.)
Severity Level: From debug to emergency
The messages are then saved to a log file, sent to a remote server, or displayed on-screen.

Severity Levels in syslog
From most critical to least:
0 - Emergency (System unusable)
1 - Alert
2 - Critical
3 - Error
4 - Warning
5 - Notice
6 - Informational
7 - Debug

Example of a syslog Entry
May 22 10:15:00 kali sshd[1024]: Accepted password for user from 192.168.1.10 port 45678 ssh2
Explanation:
Date and time: May 22 10:15:00
Hostname: kali
Service: sshd
Message: User logged in using password from IP 192.168.1.10

How to View syslog
cat /var/log/syslog → View entire file
less /var/log/syslog → Scroll through it
tail -f /var/log/syslog → See real-time logs



Audit Log:-
An audit log is a record of actions performed on a system, showing who did what, when, and how. It helps in tracking security-relevant events such as user logins, file changes, command executions, and permission modifications.

Main Purpose of Audit Logs
Monitor user and system activity
Detect suspicious or unauthorized actions
Comply with security standards (like PCI-DSS, HIPAA)
Help in digital forensics and investigations

Linux uses the Audit daemon (auditd) to maintain audit logs.
Log file location: /var/log/audit/audit.log

What Does an Audit Log Contain?
Each entry usually shows:
Time and date
User ID (UID)
Command or action
File or object accessed
Result (success or failed)
Source IP or terminal

Example of an Audit Log Entry
type=SYSCALL msg=audit(1716358455.123:421): user pid=1092 uid=1000 auid=1000 cmd="/bin/cat /etc/passwd"
Meaning:
A user with UID 1000 ran the cat command on /etc/passwd.
It happened at a specific time and was recorded by the audit system.

How to Set Up Audit Logs in Linux
Install audit daemon (if not already):
sudo apt install auditd  # Debian/Ubuntu
sudo yum install audit   # RHEL/CentOS

Start and enable the service:
sudo systemctl start auditd
sudo systemctl enable auditd

Add audit rules:
Example – log access to /etc/passwd:

sudo auditctl -w /etc/passwd -p rwxa -k passwd-watch
-w: Watch file
-p: Permissions (read, write, execute, attribute change)
-k: Add a tag for easy search
