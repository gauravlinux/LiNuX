cheap, reduce cost, free , easy backup using snapshot, easy recovery

access Linux server/Remote server using Terminal/CMD/GitBash:-
ssh kali@192.168.1.135

Transfer files from PC to Linux server/Remote server:-
using SCP [Secure Copy Protocol]
scp desktop/Linux.txt Linux2.txt kali2@10.2.11.345:/usr/tmp/
Transfer all files of a directory from PC to Linux server/Remote server:-
using SCP [Secure Copy Protocol]
scp * kali2@10.2.11.345:/usr/tmp/
Transfer files from Linux server/Remote server to PC:-
using SCP [Secure Copy Protocol]
scp kali2@10.2.11.345:/usr/tmp/linux.txt desktop/
If using a custom SSH port (e.g., 2222):
scp -P 2222 user@192.168.1.100:/home/user/backup.sql /home/user/
